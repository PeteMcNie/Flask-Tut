The database library will take care of escaping the values so you are not vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.

Instead, generate_password_hash() is used to securely hash the password, and that hash is stored. Since this query modifies data, db.commit() needs to be called afterwards to save the changes.

This is preferable to writing the URL directly as it allows you to change the URL later without changing all code that links to it. redirect() generates a redirect response to the generated URL.

The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser, and the browser then sends it back with subsequent requests. Flask securely signs the data so that it can’t be tampered with.

@bp.before_app_request # bp.before_app_request() registers a function that runs before the view function, no matter what URL is requested. load_logged_in_user checks if a user id is stored in the session and gets that user’s data from the database, storing it on g.user, which lasts for the length of the request. If there is no user id, or if the id doesn’t exist, g.user will be None.
